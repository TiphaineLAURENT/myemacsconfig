# .emacs and .emacs.d

A set of GNU/Emacs config that I use (because Emacs > all)
Probably none of them are made by me, so you can find the link where i found them after their name

## Configuration files

- EPITECH tools - **Add Epitech auto-updated header** - *[Kayofeld based on Nicolas Sadirac and Frederic Denis based on comment routines by Isaac](https://github.com/kayofeld/script-installation-ordinateur-epitech)*
